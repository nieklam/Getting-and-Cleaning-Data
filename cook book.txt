Some explanation that may help

Basically, from those raw signals, which are each divided into a signal for each axis, 
they separate out acceleration due to gravity from acceleration due to movement of 
the subject's body. 
They then combine all three axes to calculate a one-dimensional magnitude (think finding
the hypotenuse of a triangle just with an extra dimension) . 
They also calculate jerk (the derivative of acceleration, or how fast acceleration changes) 
along all three axes and calculate the one dimensional. Then things get really complicated
because they use a Fast Fourier Transform to create several new variables which are in the 
frequency domain rather than the time domain (search youtube for many videos explaining 
the difference). 
Then finally they calculate summary statistics for all of these variables, of which we only 
choose to use mean() and std() for this project. Making things even more confusing, the output 
of the summary statistics are normalized and bound between -1 and 1 rather than being in 
the same units as the raw data (m/s^2 for the accelerometer and probably radians/s for the gyroscope).

The variables (=columns) explained
 
activity                     : the activity done: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, 
                               SITTING, STANDING , LAYING              
dimension                    : the mearsured dimension in space: x, y, z. For cases where these 3 
                               dimensions are combined the category "overall" is applied 
domein                       : there are 2 domeins, the time domein (time) and the Fast Fourier 
                               Transform domein (fft). Its has all to do how the values are calculated.                  

body_acceleration            : the acceleration of the body. It has several dimensions   
body_acceleration_jerk       : the derivative of body acceleration, or how fast body acceleration changes
body_acceleration_mag        : like body_acceleration, combining the dimensions
body_acceleration_jerkmag    : like body_acceleration_jerk, combining the dimensions
   
body_gyroscoop               : the place in the space (on x,y,z dimensions)
body_gyroscoop_jerk          : like body_acceleration_jerk, but here about place in the space instand of
                               acceleration
body_gyroscoop_mag           : like body_acceleration_mag, but here about place in the space instand of 
                               acceleration
body_gyroscoop_jerkmag       : body_acceleration_jerkmag, but here about place in the space instand of 
                               acceleration



gravity_acceleration         : the acceleration due to gravity. It has several dimensions. Remember, if move 
                               you are hindered by gravity (unless you are on the moon or in outerspace). This 
                               hinder is stored in this variable
gravity_acceleration_mag     : the acceleration due to gravity, the dimensions are combined.
